## To-Do

- [x] (re)design shortcut appearance  https://get.slack.help/hc/de/articles/201374536-Tastaturk%C3%BCrzel-in-Slack
- [x] think about changing data structure 
- [x] sort by date should not work properly by default, that's why there`s need for a costum solution https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api#custom-filters
by changing the sort method accordingly https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#Parameter
- [x] Page.path has to be available for every (content-)page

- [x] logo lettering
- [x] mobile optimization

---
 
- [x] Table of Content
- [x] anchor for sections
- [ ] watch mode: show some sign of everything-is-ok after an error but only once
